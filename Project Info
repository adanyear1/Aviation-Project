Airline Problem Statement: At a busy international airport the airline has 30 gates in the domestic terminal, 
and 5 gates in the international terminal. The airline is trying to determine which aircraft are going to be 
needed for the future, so it is requesting a program that can analyze current aviation trends. 
The spreadsheet shows how busy gates are and the predicted growth.

The program can determine which aircraft will be needed in the future, 
and I will make any recommendations on how to improve the process.
